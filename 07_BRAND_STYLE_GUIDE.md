| Instead Of                | Use                                           | Why                  |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |

| "Pharmacy retail"         | "Pharmacy services"                           | Clearer to customers |
| "Pharmaceutical products" | "Medicines," "Medications"                    | Easier to understand |

| "Our esteemed customers"  | "Our customers," "You"                        | Warm, not flowery    |

### Regional Language Adjustments

**For Lagos/Nigerian Context:**

- Use "pharmacist" not "pharmacologist"
- Use "medicines" or "drugs" (common in Nigeria)
- Use ₦ symbol for currency
- Use "WhatsApp" (very common in Nigeria)
- Reference local areas (Magodo, Ketu, Ikorodu Road)
- Use "today" rather than "this day"

**Avoid:**

- American English spellings (use British English: colour, centre)
- American cultural references
- Assumptions about healthcare access
- Formal "Sir/Madam" language (feels dated)
